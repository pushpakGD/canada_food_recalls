# Government of Canada Recalls: Analysis and Visual Insights

This is one of my Data Analyst Portfolio projects focused on Food Recalls in Canada. This project is a comprehensive analysis of food recalls in Canada, fueled by data scraped from the official Canada Food Recalls website. This dataset opens a window into the complex landscape of food safety, providing valuable insights that can contribute to public health and policy decisions. This project employs comprehensive analysis and illuminating visualizations to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and potential areas for enhancement within the domain of food recalls in Canada. By exploring the data, we scrutinize critical elements such as recall frequencies, their root causes, and the types of products most frequently impacted. Through thorough examination, the aim is to pinpoint recurring issues or trends that warrant attention for bolstering food safety measures.
